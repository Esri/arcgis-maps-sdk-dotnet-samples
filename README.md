# ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET - Samples

<a href="//www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9mtp5013343h?cid=storebadge&ocid=badge"><img src="./samples_screenshot.png" title="Get the viewer from Microsoft" alt="Screenshot of the sample viewer for WPF" width="500px" /></a>

**Interactive samples demonstrate the ArcGIS Runtime API**

## Get started

If you're on Windows, the easiest way to get started is to download the viewer from the Microsoft Store:

<a href='//www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9mtp5013343h?cid=storebadge&ocid=badge'><img src='https://developer.microsoft.com/store/badges/images/English_get-it-from-MS.png' alt='Get it from Microsoft badge' width="125" /></a>

Or, you can browse a searchable list of samples on the ArcGIS for developers website:

[![Link: WinUI](https://img.shields.io/badge/WinUI-0E53BD?style=flat-square&labelColor=gray&logo=windows)](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/winui/sample-code/)
[![Link: UWP](https://img.shields.io/badge/UWP-(Legacy)-202020?style=flat-square&labelColor=gray&logo=windows)](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/uwp/sample-code/)
[![Link: Xamarin.Android](https://img.shields.io/badge/Xamarin.Android-(Legacy)-202020?style=flat-square&labelColor=gray&logo=android)](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/android/sample-code/)
[![Link: Xamarin.iOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Xamarin.iOS-(Legacy)-202020?style=flat-square&labelColor=gray&logo=ios)](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/ios/sample-code/)

> **NOTE**: Samples exist but are no longer being updated for iOS, Android, and UWP. If a sample doesn't exist on your desired platform, you can refer to the implementation on Xamarin.Forms for mobile or WPF for Windows desktop.

### Build the samples locally

If you want to modify or debug sample code, you can clone this repo and load one of the following solutions:

- All: `src\ArcGISRuntime.Viewers.All.sln`
- Windows ( WPF / UWP ): `src\ArcGISRuntime.Viewers.Windows.sln`
- Xamarin (iOS, Android, Forms): `src\ArcGISRuntime.Viewers.Xamarin.sln`

If you are only interested in one platform, you can open a platform-specific solutions:

- [WPF (.NET Framework)](src/WPF/readme.md): `src\WPF\ArcGISRuntime.WPF.Viewer.NetFramework.sln`
- [WPF (.NET 6)](src/WPF/readme.md): `src\WPF\ArcGISRuntime.WPF.Viewer.Net.sln`
- [Xamarin.Forms](src/Forms/readme.md): `src\Windows\ArcGISRuntime.Xamarin.Samples.Forms.sln`
- [WinUI](src/WinUI/readme.md): `\src\WinUI\ArcGISRuntime.WinUI.Viewer.sln (Preview)`

The following platforms are being kept for reference, but no new sample implementations are being added:

- [UWP](src/UWP/readme.md): `src\Windows\ArcGISRuntime.UWP.Viewer.sln`
- [Xamarin.Android](src/Android/readme.md): `src\Android\ArcGISRuntime.Xamarin.Samples.Android.sln`
- [Xamarin.iOS](src/iOS/readme.md): `src\iOS\ArcGISRuntime.Xamari.Samples.iOS.sln`

## Notes

> **IMPORTANT** When you run the samples, you will need to provide an API key. You can get a free developer account and key on the [ArcGIS Developers website](developers.arcgis.com). For more information see https://links.esri.com/arcgis-runtime-security-auth.

- The .NET sample viewers have a prompt for setting an API key. You can also hardcode your API key in the [`GetLocalKey() method`](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-dotnet/tree/main/src/ArcGISRuntime.Samples.Shared/Managers/ApiKeyManager.cs#L89) of the [`ApiKeyManager class`](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-dotnet/tree/main/src/ArcGISRuntime.Samples.Shared/Managers/ApiKeyManager.cs).
- Before using WinUI, install the [latest Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/) and the [vsix plugin](https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/stable-vsix-2022-cs).
- When compiling Universal Windows Platform samples, make sure that you are compiling against x86/x64/ARM platform and not using AnyCPU.

### Offline data

Several samples require local data to function properly. That data is downloaded to local storage automatically when a sample is run.
This process is handled by the `DataManager` class (located in the 'Managers' folder in each viewer project). Samples
that use the data manager to download their data are differentiated as follows:

- They have `RequiresOfflineData` set to true in their metadata.json files
- They have one or more entries under `DataItemIds` in their metadata.json files (these are portal item Ids)
- They use the data manager to identify the correct path for their offline files at run time
