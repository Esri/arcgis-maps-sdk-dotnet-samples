## Samples - Table of Contents

See Table of Contents under different platforms
  * [WPF](src/WPF)
  * [Universal Windows Platform](src/UWP)
  * [Xamarin Android](src/Android)
  * [Xamarin iOS](src/iOS)
  * [Xamarin Forms](src/Forms) 

## Instructions 

1. Fork and then clone the repo or download the .zip file. 
2. Confirm the supported system configuration for the API of interest in the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET:
  * [WPF](http://developers.arcgis.com/net/desktop/guide/system-requirements.htm)
  * [UWP](http://developers.arcgis.com/net/uwp/guide/system-requirements.htm)
  * [Xamarin Android](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/android/guide/system-requirements.htm)
  * [Xamarin iOS](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/ios/guide/system-requirements.htm)
  * [Xamarin Forms](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/forms/guide/system-requirements.htm) 
3. In Visual Studio, open the solution, clean, build and run the application
  * WPF: `src\Desktop\ArcGISRuntime.WPF.Viewer.sln`  
  * UWP: `src\Windows\ArcGISRuntime.UWP.Viewer.sln`  
  * Xamarin Android: `src\Android\ArcGISRuntime.Xamarin.Samples.Android.sln`  
  * Xamarin iOS: `src\iOS\ArcGISRuntime.Xamari.Samples.iOS.sln`  
  * Xamarin Forms: `src\Windows\ArcGISRuntime.Xamarin.Samples.Forms.sln`  
  
  or
  
  * All: `src\ArcGISRuntime.Viewers.All.sln`
  * Windows ( WPF / UWP ): `src\ArcGISRuntime.Viewers.Windows.sln`
  * Xamarin (iOs, Android, Forms): `src\ArcGISRuntime.Viewers.Xamarin.sln`  
  
Notes:

Running sample viewer for WPF / UWP so that it uses VB samples
  * WPF
       To run samples in VB, your sample viewer can be started with `/vb` parameter on start up. When the application is compiled, we also deploy `Launch Viewer VB.bat` file to the output folder.
       
   * Universal Windows Platform
      To run samples in VB, you need to manually change the constant in `App.cs` file. 
      
      ````CSharp
      private const Language SamplesLanguageUsed = Language.CSharp;
      // or 
      private const Language SamplesLanguageUsed = Language.VBnet;
      ````
When compiling Universal Windows Platform samples, make sure that you are compiling against x86/x64/ARM platform and not using AnyCPU.
