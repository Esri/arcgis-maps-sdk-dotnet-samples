# arcgis-runtime-samples-dotnet

This project contains samples for the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET - Desktop, Store, and Phone APIs.  Samples for each API are hosted in a simple application framework.  

## Instructions 

1. Fork and then clone the repo or download the .zip file. 
2. Download and install the [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/).  
3. Confirm the supported system configuration for the API of interest in the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET:
  * [Windows Desktop](http://developers.arcgis.com/net/desktop/guide/system-requirements.htm)
  * [Windows Phone](http://developers.arcgis.com/net/store/guide/system-requirements.htm)
  * [Windows Store](http://developers.arcgis.com/net/store/guide/system-requirements.htm) 
4. In Visual Studio, open the solution for the Desktop, Phone, or Store samples.   
  * Windows Desktop: src\Desktop\ArcGISRuntimeSDKDotNet_DesktopSamples.sln  
	   - Clean, build, and run the application.
  * Windows Phone: src\Phone\ArcGISRuntimeSDKDotNet_PhoneSamples.sln  
	   - In Visual Studio go to Build > Configuration Manager.  Select the appropriate active solution platform.  If deploying to a device, use ARM.  If deploying to the emulator, use x86.
	   - Clean, build, and run the application.
  * Windows Store: src\Store\ArcGISRuntimeSDKDotNet_StoreSamples.sln  
    - In Visual Studio go to Build > Configuration Manager.  Select the appropriate active solution platform.  If deploying to a Windows RT 8.1 device, use ARM.  If deploying to a Windows 8.1 device (or simulator), select the appropriate processor type, x86 or x64.  
    - Clean, build, and run the application.

Notes:
* Sample data for ArcGIS Runtime SDKs is included as a submodule with this repo: https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-data.  If downloading the zip or using a source control application that does not pull submodules from this repo, get the sample data from https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-data directly.  Place sample data contents in a folder named "sample-data" at the same level as the "src" folder for this repo.
* The Windows Phone samples project contains a reference to the Nuget package for the [Windows Phone Toolkit](http://www.nuget.org/packages/WPtoolkit/).  To enable download of Nuget packages on project build, in Visual Studio go to Tools > Options > Package Manager and check the box next to "Allow Nuget to download missing packages during build".  You can also choose to download and install the [October 2012 version of the Windows Phone Toolkit](http://phone.codeplex.com/).
