# ArcGIS Maps SDK for .NET - Samples

<a href="//www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9mtp5013343h?cid=storebadge&ocid=badge"><img src="./samples_screenshot.png" title="Get the viewer from Microsoft" alt="Screenshot of the sample viewer for WPF" width="500px" /></a>

**Interactive samples demonstrate the ArcGIS Maps SDK for .NET API**

## Get started

If you're on Windows, the easiest way to get started is to download the viewer from the Microsoft Store:

<a href='//www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9mtp5013343h?cid=storebadge&ocid=badge'><img src='https://developer.microsoft.com/store/badges/images/English_get-it-from-MS.png' alt='Get it from Microsoft badge' width="125" /></a>

Or, you can browse a searchable list of samples on the ArcGIS for developers website:

[![Link: WinUI](https://img.shields.io/badge/WinUI-0E53BD?style=flat-square&labelColor=gray&logo=windows)](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/winui/sample-code/)
[![Link: UWP](https://img.shields.io/badge/UWP-(Legacy)-202020?style=flat-square&labelColor=gray&logo=windows)](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/uwp/sample-code/)

### Build the samples locally

If you want to modify or debug sample code, you can clone this repo and load one of the following solutions:

- All: `src\ArcGIS.Viewers.All.sln`
- .NET MAUI (iOS, Android): `src\MAUI\ArcGIS.Samples.Maui.sln`

If you are only interested in one platform, you can open a platform-specific solutions:

- [WPF .NET](src/WPF/readme.md): `src\WPF\WPF.Viewer.Net.sln`
- [.NET MAUI](src/MAUI/readme.md): `src\MAUI\ArcGIS.Samples.Maui.sln`
- [WinUI](src/WinUI/readme.md): `src\WinUI\ArcGIS.WinUI.Viewer.sln`

When the `ArcGIS.Viewers.All.sln` and `WPF.Viewer.Net.sln` are opened in Visual Studio, you can change the framework to .NET Framework from the debug button dropdown menu.

The following platforms are being kept for reference, but no new sample implementations are being added:

- [UWP](src/UWP/readme.md): `src\Windows\ArcGIS.UWP.Viewer.sln`

## Notes

> **IMPORTANT** When you run the samples, you will need to provide an API key. You can get a free developer account and key on the [ArcGIS Developers website](developers.arcgis.com). For more information see https://links.esri.com/arcgis-runtime-security-auth.

- The .NET sample viewers have a prompt for setting an API key. You can also hardcode your API key in the [`GetLocalKey() method`](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-maps-sdk-dotnet-samples/blob/main/src/Samples.Shared/Managers/ApiKeyManager.cs#L112) of the [`ApiKeyManager class`](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-maps-sdk-dotnet-samples/blob/main/src/Samples.Shared/Managers/ApiKeyManager.cs).
- Before using WinUI, install the [latest Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/) and the [vsix plugin](https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/stable-vsix-2022-cs).
- When compiling Universal Windows Platform or WinUI samples, make sure that you are compiling against x86/x64/ARM platform and not using AnyCPU.

### Offline data

Several samples require local data to function properly. That data is downloaded to local storage automatically when a sample is run.
This process is handled by the `DataManager` class (located in the 'Managers' folder in each viewer project). Samples
that use the data manager to download their data are differentiated as follows:

- They have `RequiresOfflineData` set to true in their metadata.json files
- They have one or more entries under `DataItemIds` in their metadata.json files (these are portal item Ids)
- They use the data manager to identify the correct path for their offline files at run time
