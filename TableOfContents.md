* [Develop your first map app](src/Desktop/ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Tutorials/FirstMapApp)

    This tutorial illustrates the simplest way to build a mapping app with the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET: create a new Visual Studio project from the SDK mapping application template.

## Maps


- **MapView**

    * [Map rotation](src/Desktop/ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/MapView/MapRotation)

    This sample demonstrates how to rotate a map.


- **Map**

    * [Open an existing map](src/Desktop/ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/Map/MapFromPortal)

    This sample demonstrates how to open an existing map from a portal. The sample opens with a map displayed by default. You can change the shown map by selecting a new one from the populated list.

## Layers


- **Tiled Layers**

    * [ArcGIS tiled layer](src/Desktop/ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/Layers/ArcGISTiledLayer)

    The Tiled Layer from URL sample is one of the most basic .Net SDK samples. This example covers using ArcGISTiledLayer as a Basemap, as well as adding the required map and MapView elements. By default, this map supports basic zooming and panning operations.


- **Map Image Layers**

    * [ArcGIS map image layer](src/Desktop/ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/Layers/ArcGISMapImageLayer)

    The image layer from URL sample is one of the most basic .Net SDK samples. This example covers using ArcGISMapImageLayer as a Basemap, as well as adding the required map and MapView elements. By default, this map supports basic zooming and panning operations.

## Features

## Display Information


- **Symbology**

    * [Unique value renderer](src/Desktop/ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/Symbology/UniqueValueRenderer)

    This sample demonstrates how to use a unique value renderer to style different features in a feature layer with different symbols. Unlike graphics, features do not have a symbol property for you to set. Instead, renderers should be used to define the symbol for features in a feature layer. The unique value renderer allows for separate symbols to be used for features that have specific attribute values in a defined field.
