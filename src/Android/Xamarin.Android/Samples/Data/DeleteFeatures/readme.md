2. Create a `FeatureLayer` from the service feature table.
3. Select features from the feature layer via `FeatureLayer.SelectFeatures()`.
4. Remove the selected features from the ServiceFeatureTable using `ServiceFeatureTable.DeleteFeatureAsync()`.
5. Update the table on the server using `ServiceFeatureTable.ApplyEditsAsync()`.
