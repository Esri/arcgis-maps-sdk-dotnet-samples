# Analyze hotspots

This sample demonstrates how to execute the GeoprocessingTask asynchronously to calculate a hotspot analysis based on the frequency of 911 calls. It calculates the frequency of these calls within a given study area during a specified constrained time period set between 1/1/1998 and 5/31/1998.
