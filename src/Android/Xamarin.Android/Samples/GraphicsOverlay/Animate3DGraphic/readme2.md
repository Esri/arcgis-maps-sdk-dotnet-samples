## Instructions

Click-and-drag to pan the sceneview, orbiting the moving plane. Click 'Camera' to toggle between the default and the orbiting camera controller.
The plane's route is shown on the inset map in the bottom left corner of the screen. The progress through the plane's mission is shown in a slider within the stats panel. Click 'Stats' to toggle stats display. Drag the slider to seek through the mission (like you might seek through a song). Tap 'Mission' to choose from a list of alternative routes. 

Note that this is a graphics-intensive sample; performance may be degraded in certain situations (such as using a simulator).
