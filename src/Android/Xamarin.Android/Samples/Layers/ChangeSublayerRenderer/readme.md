# Change sublayer renderer

Apply a renderer to a sublayer.

## Use case

A layer showing animal populations contains sublayers for different species. A renderer could be applied which gives each sublayer a different color, so that populations of each species can be compared visually.

## How to use the sample

Wait for the map image layer to load. Tap the button to apply a unique value renderer to see different population ranges in the counties sub-layer data.

## How it works

1. Create an `ArcGISMapImageLayer` from its URL.
2. After it is done loading, get its `SublayerList` with `imageLayer.Sublayers`.
3. Cast the sublayer you want to change to the appropriate type: `(ArcGISMapImageSublayer) sublayers[0]`.
4. Create a `ClassBreaksRenderer` with a collection of `ClassBreak`s for different population ranges.
5. Set the renderer of the sublayer with `sublayer.Renderer = renderer`.

* ArcGISMapImageSubLayer
* ClassBreaksRenderer
* ClassBreaksRenderer.ClassBreak

## About the data

This application displays census data from an ArcGIS Server map service. It contains various population statistics, including total population for each county in 2007.

## Additional information

The service hosting the layer must support dynamic layers to be able to change the rendering of sublayers.
