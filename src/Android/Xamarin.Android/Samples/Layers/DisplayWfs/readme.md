## Use case

WFS is an open standard with functionality similar to ArcGIS feature services. Runtime support for WFS allows you to interoperate with open systems, which are often used in inter-agency efforts, like those for disaster relief.

## How to use the sample

Pan and zoom to see features within the current map extent.

## How it works

1. Create a `WfsFeatureTable` with a URL.
2. Create a `FeatureLayer` from the feature table and add it to the map.
3. Listen for the `MapView.NavigationCompleted` event to detect when the user has stopped navigating the map.
4. When the user is finished navigating, use `PopulateFromServiceAsync` to load the table with data for the current visible extent.
