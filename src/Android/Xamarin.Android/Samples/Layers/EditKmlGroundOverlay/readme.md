## Use case

KML ground overlays are used for showing aerial imagery, symbology, or other images draped over a scene. Changing the geometry, rotation, and other attributes of a ground overlay after it has been loaded allows for live editing.  For example, editing the geometry and opacity of a historical image draped over present day satellite imagery makes it possible to view change over time.

## How to use the sample

Use the slider to adjust the opacity of the ground overlay.

## How it works

1. Create an `Envelope` defining the geometry of the overlay.
2. Create a `KmlIcon` using a `Uri` linking to an image.
3. Create a `KmlGroundOverlay` using the envelope and icon.
4. Set the value of`KmlGroundOverlay.Rotation`.
5. Create a `KmlDataset` using the ground overlay.
6. Create a `KmlLayer` using the dataset.
7. Add the KML layer to the scene.
8. Listen for changes to the opacity slider and change the `KmlGroundOverlay.Color` value appropriately.
