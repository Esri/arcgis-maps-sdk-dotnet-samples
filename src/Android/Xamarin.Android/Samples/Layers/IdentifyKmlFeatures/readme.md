## Use case

A user may wish to select a KML feature to view relevant information about it.

## How to use the sample

Tap a feature to identify it. Feature information will be displayed in a callout.

Note: the KML layer used in this sample contains a screen overlay. The screen overlay contains a legend and the logos for NOAA and the NWS. You can't identify the screen overlay.

## How it works

1. Create a listener for the `GeoViewTapped` event of the `MapView`.
2. On tap:
  * Dismiss the `Callout`, if one is showing.
  * Call `IdentifyLayersAsync(...)` passing in the `KmlLayer`, screen point and tolerance.
  * Await the result of the identify and then get the `KmlPlacemark` from the result.
  * Create a callout at the calculated map point and populate the callout content with text from the placemark's `BalloonContent`. NOTE: KML supports defining HTML for balloon content and may need to be converted from HTML to text.
  * Show the callout.
  
Note: There are several types of KML features. This sample only identifies features of type `KmlPlacemark`.
