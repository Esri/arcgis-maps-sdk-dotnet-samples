##IWA Authentication##

This sample illustrates the use of Windows credentials to access services hosted on a portal secured with Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA).
When accessing an item secured with IWA, default credentials (the login that started the app, i.e.) are only sent to the portal from a WPF app. 
Platforms such as Android, iOS, and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) require credentials to be entered explicitly, either by prompting the user 
for them or by hard-coding them into the app.
The sample allows you to define a Windows credential in the code (username, password, and domain) or to prompt the user when accessing a secure resource.
