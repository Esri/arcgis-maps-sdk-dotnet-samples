Token Secured Services (Challenge method) - Desktop

This sample demonstrates accessing secured services using token-based authentication. Token-based authentication is supported for ArcGIS Server, ArcGIS Online, and Portal for ArcGIS. The application is responsible for providing a dialog to prompt the user for credentials. With the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET, you can use the IdentityManager to challenge for credentials when the Map tries to access a secure service.
