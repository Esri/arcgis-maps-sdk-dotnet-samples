# Convex hull list

This sample demonstrates how to use the GeometryEngine.ConvexHull to generate convex hull polygon(s) from multiple input geometries.

## Instructions

Click the 'ConvexHull' button to create convex hull(s) from the polygon graphics. If the 'Union' checkbox is checked, the resulting output will be one polygon being the convex hull for the two input polygons. If the 'Union' checkbox is un-checked, the resulting output will have two convex hull polygons - one for each of the two input polygons.
