## Use case

Use a dictionary renderer on a graphics overlay to display more transient data, such as military messages coming through a local tactical network.

## How to use the sample

Pan and zoom to explore military symbols on the map.

## How it works

1. Create a new `DictionarySymbolStyle(dictionaryPath)`.
2. Create a new `DictionaryRenderer(symbolDictionary)`.
3. Create a new `GraphicsOverlay`
4. Set the  dictionary renderer to the graphics overlay.
5. Parse through the XML and create a graphic for each element.
6. Use the `_wkid` key to get the geometry's spatial reference.
7. Use the `_control_points` key to get the geometry's shape.
8. Create a geometry using the shape and spatial reference from above.
9. Create a `Graphic` for each attribute, utilizing it's defined geometry.
10. Add the graphic to the graphics overlay.
