# Change basemap

Change a map's basemap. A basemap is beneath all layers on a `Map` and is used to provide visual reference for the operational layers.

## Use case

Basemaps should be selected contextually. For example, in maritime applications, it would be more appropriate to use a basemap of the world's oceans as opposed to a basemap of the world's streets.

## How to use the sample

When the basemap gallery appears, select a basemap to be displayed.

## How it works

1. Create an `Map` object.
2. Set the map to the `MapView` object.
3. Create a `BasemapGallery` using the toolkit.
4. Bind the `Geomodel` property from the `BasemapGallery` object to the `MapView` map.

## Additional Information

This samples uses the basemap gallery toolkit component, which requires the [toolkit](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-toolkit-dotnet) to be cloned and set up locally. For information about setting up the toolkit, visit the [repository](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-toolkit-dotnet/blob/main/README.md).
