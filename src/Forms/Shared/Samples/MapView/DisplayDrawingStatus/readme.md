# Display draw status

Get the draw status of your map view or scene view to know when all layers in the map or scene have finished drawing.

## Use case

You may want to display a loading indicator while layers are loading, which could then be removed on `DrawStatus.Completed`.

## How to use the sample

Pan and zoom around the map. Observe how the status changes from a loading animation to solid, indicating that drawing has completed.

## How it works

1. Create a `MapView` and subscribe to the `DrawStatusChanged` event.
2. Inspect the draw status property in the event handler to determine draw status.
