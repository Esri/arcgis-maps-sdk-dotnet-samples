# Simple renderer

Display common symbols for all graphics in a graphics overlay with a renderer.

## Use case

Graphics are often used to display data that changes location regularly because they are held in memory instead of being persisted to the map. When a number of graphics are required to share the same style, a simple renderer can be applied to the graphics overlay containing the graphics. For example, the location of mobile taxis from a same company could be plotted on a map with each taxi marked by a relevant symbol.

## How to use the sample

The sample loads with a predefined simple renderer, which displays a red cross simple marker symbol for the graphics in the graphics overlay.

## How it works

1. Create a `GraphicsOverlay`.
2. Create a number of `Point` objects with x, y and spatial reference parameters.
3. Create a `SimpleMarkerSymbol` passing in a `SimpleMarkerSymbol.Style`, color and size as parameters.
4. Create a simple renderer with `SimpleRenderer(simpleMarkerSymbol)`.
5. Set the simple renderer to the graphics overlay using `graphicsOverlay.setRenderer(simpleRenderer)`.
6. Create a number of `Graphic` objects with the points initiated in step 2.
7. Add the graphics to the graphics overlay with `graphicsOverlay.Graphics.Add(graphic)`.

## Additional information

Renderers are used to display graphics that don't already have a symbol set. A renderer will not override a graphic's symbol if one has been set.
