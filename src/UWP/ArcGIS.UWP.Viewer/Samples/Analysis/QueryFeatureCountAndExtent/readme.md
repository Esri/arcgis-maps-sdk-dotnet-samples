# Query feature count and extent

Zoom to features matching a query and count the features in the current visible extent.

## Use case

Queries can be used to search for features in a feature table using text entry. This is helpful for finding a specific feature by name in a large feature table. A query can also be used to count features in an extent. This could be used to count the number of a traffic incidents in a particular region when working with an incident dataset for a larger area.

## How to use the sample

Use the button to zoom to the extent of the state specified (by abbreviation) in the textbox or use the button to count the features in the current extent.

## How it works

Querying by state abbreviation:

1. A `QueryParameters` object is created with a `WhereClause`.
2. `FeatureTable.QueryExtentAsync` is called with the `QueryParameters` object to obtain the extent that contains all matching features.
3. The extent is converted to a `Viewpoint`, which is passed to `MapView.SetViewpointAsync`.

Counting features in the current extent:

1. The current visible extent is obtained from a call to `MapView.GetCurrentViewpoint(ViewpointType)`.
2. A `QueryParameters` object is created with the visible extent and a defined `SpatialRelationship` (in this case 'intersects').
3. The count of matching features is obtained from a call to `FeatureTable.QueryFeatureCountAsync`.

## About the data

See the [Medicare Hospital Spending per Patient, 2016](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=c8810b20c01b4e8ba5cd848966a66d7b#overview) layer on ArcGIS Online.

Hospitals in blue/turquoise spend less than the national average. Red/salmon indicates higher spending relative to other hospitals, while gray is average.
