Display features from a local GeoPackage.

## Use case

Useful for applications which consume data maintained by a local source on
the device running the application.

## How it works

1. Create a `GeoPackage` passing the URI string into the constructor.
2. Load the `GeoPackage` with `GeoPackage.loadAsync`
3. When it's done loading, get the `GeoPackageFeatureTable` objects from the geopackage with `geoPackage.getGeoPackageFeatureTables()`
4. Create a `FeatureLayer(featureTable)` for each feature table and add it to the map as an operational layer. Add each to the map as an operational layer with `map.OperationalLayers.Add(featureLayer)`.
