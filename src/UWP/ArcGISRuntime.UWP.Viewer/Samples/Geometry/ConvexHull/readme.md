# Convex hull

Create a convex hull for a given set of points. The convex hull is a polygon with shortest perimeter that encloses a set of points. As a visual analogy, consider a set of points as nails in a board. The convex hull of the points would be like a rubber band stretched around the outermost nails.

## Use case

A convex hull can be useful in collision detection. For example, when charting the position of two yacht fleets (with each vessel represented by a point), if their convex hulls have been precomputed, it is efficient to first check if their convex hulls intersect before computing their proximity point-by-point.

## How to use the sample

Tap on the map to add points. Click the button to generate the convex hull of those points. Click "Reset" to start over.

## How it works

1. Create an input geometry such as a `Multipoint` object.
2. Use `GeometryEngine.ConvexHull(inputGeometry)`to create a new `Geometry` object representing the convex hull of the input points. The returned geometry will either be a `Point`, `Polyline`, or `Polygon` based on the number of input points.
