## Use case

A field worker could annotate features of interest on a map (via the GUI) such as location of dwellings (marked as points), geological features (polylines), or areas of glaciation (polygons). 

## How to use the sample

Click 'Draw/Edit', then choose which geometry type to sketch.

Use the control panel to undo or redo changes made to the sketch and to complete the sketch. There is also the option to select a saved graphic and edit its geometry using the Sketch Editor. The graphics overlay can be cleared using the clear button.
