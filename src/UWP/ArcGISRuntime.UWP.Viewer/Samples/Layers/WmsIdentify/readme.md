## How to use the sample

Tap a feature to identify it. The HTML content associated with the feature will be displayed in a web view. 

## How it works

1. A WMS layer is added via URL and a layer name.
2. When the map is tapped, `MapView.IdentifyLayerAsync` is used to find matching results within the WMS layer.
3. If there is a matching feature, the HTML property is taken via a lookup in the feature's attribute dictionary.
4. This particular server will produce an identify result with an empty table when there is no identified feature. In all other cases, a table with an **OBJECTID** column is added. This sample checks for the presence of **OBJECTID** in the HTML, and doesn't display the result if it is missing.
5. The HTML is displayed in the web view.
