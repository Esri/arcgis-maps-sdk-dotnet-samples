# Create terrain from local tile package

Set the terrain surface with elevation described by a local tile package.

## Use case

In a scene view, the terrain surface is what the basemap, operational layers, and graphics are draped onto. For example, when viewing a scene in a mountainous region, applying a terrain surface to the scene will help in recognizing the slopes, valleys, and elevated areas.

## How to use the sample

When loaded, the sample will show a scene with a terrain surface applied. Pan and zoom to explore the scene and observe how the terrain surface allows visualizing elevation differences.

## How it works

1. Create a `Scene` and add it to a `SceneView`.
2. Create an `ArcGISTiledElevationSource` with the path to the local tile package.
3. Add this source to the scene's base surface: `Scene.BaseSurface.ElevationSources.Add(tiledElevationSource)`.

## Relevant API

* ArcGISTiledElevationSource
* Surface

## Additional information

The tile package must be a LERC (limited error raster compression) encoded TPK. Details on can be found in the topic [Share a tile package](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/sharing/overview/tile-package.htm) in the *ArcGIS Pro* documentation.
