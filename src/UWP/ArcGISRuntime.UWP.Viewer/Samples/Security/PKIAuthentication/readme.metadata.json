After loading the certificate, requests\nto the portal can be encrypted and decrypted using public key cryptography. The portal can then be searched for web maps to display in the map view.    \n     \nMore information about PKI and client certificates can be found at the links below:\n - [PKI - MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb427432(v=vs.85).aspx)\n - [PKI - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure)\n - [Certificates - MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb540819(v=vs.85).aspx)",
