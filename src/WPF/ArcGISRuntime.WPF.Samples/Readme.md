# ArcGIS Runtime SDK - WPF Sample Viewer

The WPF sample viewer includes samples that depend on Local Server. 
If you would like to use those samples, you must install Local Server. 
See https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/wpf/guide/local-server.htm 
for details and instructions.

If you do not want to install Local Server, you may proceed without it. 
When you try to build the project, you will get a build error:

> ArcGIS Runtime Local Server SDK v100.2 component not installed. 
> Local Server is required to build this project. Download and install 
> Local Server from http://links.esri.com/arcgis-runtime-local-server-sdk-v100
> ArcGISRuntime.WPF.Viewer			

Click 'Start' or press F5 again and the project will start despite the build
error.
