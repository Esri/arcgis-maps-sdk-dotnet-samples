  "Instructions": "This sample depends on the local server being installed and configured. See https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/wpf/guide/local-server.htm for details and instructions.\nClick on the 'Choose Shapefile' button to select a shapefile. The file picker will start in the sample viewer's offline data directory. Sample shapefiles are loaded in the background. ",
