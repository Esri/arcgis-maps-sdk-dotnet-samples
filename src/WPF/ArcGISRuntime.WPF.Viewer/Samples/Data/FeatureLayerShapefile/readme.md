## Use case

Shapefiles store location, shape and attributes of geospatial vector data. Shapefiles can be loaded directly into ArcGIS Runtime.

## How it works

1. Create a `ShapefileFeatureTable` passing in the URL of a shapefile.
2. Create a `FeatureLayer` using the shapefile feature table.
3. Add the layer to the map's operation layers.
