# Service feature table (no cache)

Display a feature layer from a service using the **no cache** feature request mode.

## Use case

`ServiceFeatureTable` supports three request modes, which define how features are requested from the service and stored in the local table. The feature request modes have different performance characteristics. Use **no cache** in scenarios where you always want the freshest data. See [Table performance concepts](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/wpf/guide/layers.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_40F10593308A4718971C9A8F5FB9EC7D) to learn more.

## How it works

1. Set the `ServiceFeatureTable.FeatureRequestMode` property of the service feature table to `NO_CACHE` before the table is loaded.
2. Add the table to the map using a `FeatureLayer`; features will be requested for the visible extent as the user pans and zooms.

## About the data

The U.S. National Bridge Inventory describes 600,000 bridges in the United States. The sample uses a modified copy of the inventory hosted in [ArcGIS Online](https://arcgisruntime.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=250b103a722c4e1ea71e562eac61be1b). The sample opens with an initial visible extent centered over Bridgeport, CT.

## Additional information

In **no cache** mode, features are automatically populated from the service for the visible extent. Each time the user pans and zooms, features are downloaded for the visible extent. Features are still cached in a local geodatabase for display, but the cache will always be populated with the latest data after navigation.

> **NOTE**: **No cache** does not guarantee that features won't be cached locally; feature request mode is a performance concept unrelated to data security.
