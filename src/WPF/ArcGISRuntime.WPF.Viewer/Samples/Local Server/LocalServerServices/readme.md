## Use case

For executing offline geoprocessing tasks in your ArcGIS Runtime apps via an offline (local) server.

## How to use the sample

Click `Start Local Server` to start the Local Server. Click `Stop Local Server` to stop the Local Server.

The `Map Service` control lets you to pick a local service that is available.

After browsing for the desired file, click `Start Service` to start the selected service.

When the running service's url appears, select it and click `Navigate to service`. To stop this running service, click `Stop Service`.

## How it works

To start a `LocalServer` and attach a `LocalService`:

1. Create and run a local server with `LocalServer.Instance`.
2. Start the server asynchronously with `server.StartAsync()`.
3. Create and run a local service. Here is an example of running a `LocalMapService`:
    1. Instantiate `LocalMapService(Url)` to create a local map service with the given URL path to map package (`mpk` or `mpkx` file).
    2. Start the job with `LocalMapService.StartAsync()`. The service is added to the `LocalServer` automatically.
4.  Stop the local server with `LocalServer.Instance.StopAsync()`.
