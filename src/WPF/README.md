## Maps

* [Change viewpoint](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/MapView/ChangeViewpoint)

    This sample demonstrates how the current viewpoint can be changed. This Sample opens with a default service viewpoint. Each subsequent button click will change the viewpoint using different methods (one to a provided extent, another a point and scale, and another to rotate the viewpoint by 90 degrees.

* [Map rotation](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/MapView/MapRotation)

    This sample demonstrates how to rotate a map.

* [Display drawing status](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/MapView/DisplayDrawingStatus)

    This sample demonstrates how to use the DrawStatus value of the MapView to notify user that the MapView is drawing.

* [Display layer view state](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/MapView/DisplayLayerViewState)

    This sample demonstrates how to get view status for layers in a map.

* [Take Screenshot](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/MapView/TakeScreenshot)

    This sample demonstrates how you can take screenshot of a map. Click 'take screenshot' button to take a screenshot of the visible area of the map. Created image is shown in the sample after creation.

* [Display a map](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/Map/DisplayMap)

    This samples demonstrates how to display a map with a basemap

* [Open an existing map](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/Map/OpenExistingMap)

    This sample demonstrates how to open an existing map from a portal. The sample opens with a map displayed by default. You can change the shown map by selecting a new one from the populated list.

* [Set Min & Max Scale](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/Map/SetMinMaxScale)

    This sample demonstrates how to set the minimum and maximum scale of a Map. Setting the minimum and maximum scale for the Map can be useful in keeping the user focused at a certain level of detail.

* [Access load status](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/Map/AccessLoadStatus)

    This sample demonstrates how to access the Maps' LoadStatus. The LoadStatus will be considered loaded when the following are true: The Map has a valid SpatialReference and the Map has an been set to the MapView.

* [Set initial map location](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/Map/SetInitialMapLocation)

    This sample creates a map with a standard ESRI Imagery with Labels basemap that is centered on a latitude and longitude location and zoomed into a specific level of detail.

* [Set initial map area](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/Map/SetInitialMapArea)

    This sample demonstrates how to set the initial viewpoint from envelope defined by minimum (x,y) and maximum (x,y) values. The map's InitialViewpoint is set to this viewpoint before the map is loaded into the MapView. Upon loading the map zoom to this initial area.

* [Set map spatial reference](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/Map/SetMapSpatialReference)

    This sample demonstrates how you can set the spatial reference on a Map and all the layers would project accordingly.

* [Change basemap](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/Map/ChangeBasemap)

    This sample demonstrates how to dynamically change the basemap displayed in a Map.

## Layers

* [ArcGIS tiled layer (URL)](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/Layers/ArcGISTiledLayerUrl)

    This sample demonstrates how to add an ArcGISTiledLayer as a base layer in a map. The ArcGISTiledLayer comes from an ArcGIS Server sample web service.

* [ArcGIS map image layer (URL)](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/Layers/ArcGISMapImageLayerUrl)

    The image layer from URL sample is one of the most basic .Net SDK samples. This example covers using ArcGISMapImageLayer as a Basemap, as well as adding the required map and MapView elements. By default, this map supports basic zooming and panning operations.

* [Change sublayer visibility](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/Layers/ChangeSublayerVisibility)

    This sample demonstrates how to show or hide sublayers of a map image layer.

## Features

* [Feature layer (feature service)](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/Layers/FeatureLayerUrl)

    This sample demonstrates how to show a feature layer on a map using the URL to the service.

* [Change feature layer renderer](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/Layers/ChangeFeatureLayerRenderer)

    This sample demonstrates how to change renderer for a feature layer. It also shows how to reset the renderer back to the default.

* [Feature layer selection](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/Layers/FeatureLayerSelection)

    This sample demonstrates how to select features in a feature layer by tapping a MapView.

* [Feature layer definition expression](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/Layers/FeatureLayerDefinitionExpression)

    This sample demonstrates how to apply definition expression to a feature layer for filtering features. It also shows how to reset the definition expression.

* [Service feature table (cache)](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/Data/ServiceFeatureTableCache)

    This sample demonstrates how to use a feature service in on interaction cache mode.

* [Service feature table (no cache)](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/Data/ServiceFeatureTableNoCache)

    This sample demonstrates how to use a feature service in on interaction no cache mode.

* [Service feature table (manual cache)](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/Data/ServiceFeatureTableManualCache)

    This sample demonstrates how to use a feature service in manual cache mode.

* [Feature layer query](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/Data/FeatureLayerQuery)

    This sample demonstrates how to query a feature layer via feature table.

## Display Information

* [Add graphics (Renderer)](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/GraphicsOverlay/AddGraphicsRenderer)

    This sample demonstrates how you add graphics and set a renderer on a graphic overlays.

* [Identify graphics](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/GraphicsOverlay/IdentifyGraphics)

    This sample demonstrates how to identify graphics in a graphics overlay. When you tap on a graphic on the map, you will see an alert message displayed.

* [Render simple markers](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/Symbology/RenderSimpleMarkers)

    This sample adds a point graphic to a graphics overlay symbolized with a red circle specified via a SimpleMarkerSymbol.

* [Render picture markers](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/Symbology/RenderPictureMarkers)

    This sample demonstrates how to create picture marker symbols from a URL and embedded resources.

* [Render unique values](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/Symbology/RenderUniqueValues)

    This sample demonstrate how to use a unique value renderer to style different features in a feature layer with different symbols. Features do not have a symbol property for you to set, renderers should be used to define the symbol for features in feature layers. The unique value renderer allows for separate symbols to be used for features that have specific attribute values in a defined field.

## Location

* [Display Device Location](ArcGISRuntime.Desktop.Samples/Samples/Location/DisplayDeviceLocation)

    This sample demonstrates how you can enable location services and switch between different types of auto pan modes.
