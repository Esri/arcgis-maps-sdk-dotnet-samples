# ArcGIS Maps SDK - WPF Sample Viewer

The WPF sample viewer includes samples that depend on Local Server. 
If you would like to use those samples, you must install Local Server. 
See the [Local Server](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/local-server/)
topic in the developers guide for more information.

If you do not want to install Local Server, you may proceed without it. 
When you try to build the project, you will get a build error.	

Click 'Start' or press F5 again and the project will start despite the build
error.
