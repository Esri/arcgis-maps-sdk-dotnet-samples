# Local Server map image layer

Start the Local Server and Local Map Service, create an ArcGIS Map Image Layer from the Local Map Service, and add it to a map.

## Use case

For executing offline geoprocessing tasks in your ArcGIS Runtime apps via an offline (local) server.

## How to use the sample

The Local Server and local map service will automatically be started and, once running, a map image layer will be created and added to the map.

## How it works

1. Create and run a local server with `LocalServer.Instance`.
2. Start the server asynchronously with `server.StartAsync()`.
3. Create and run a local service, example of running a `LocalMapService`.
    1. Instantiate `LocalMapService(Url)` to create a local map service with the given URL path to the map package (`mpkx` file).
    2. Start the service asynchronously with `LocalMapService.StartAsync()`. The service is added to the Local Server automatically.
4. Create an ArcGIS map image layer from local map service.
   1. Create a `ArcGISMapImageLayer(Url)` from local map service url provided by the `LocalMapService.Url` property.
   2. Add the layer to the map's operational layers. 
   3. Wait for the layer to load with `await myImageLayer.LoadAsync()`
   4. Set the map view's extent to the layer's full extent.

## Offline data

This sample downloads the following items from ArcGIS Online automatically:

* [RelationshipID.mpkx](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=85c34847bbe1402fa115a1b9b87561ce) - This map package is included in the ArcGIS Runtime sample data.

## Additional information

Local Server can be downloaded for Windows and Linux platforms from the [developers website](https://developers.arcgis.com/downloads/apis-and-sdks?product=local-server#arcgis-runtime-local-server). Local Server is not supported on macOS.
