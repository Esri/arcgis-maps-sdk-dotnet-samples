## Security

* [Certificate authentication with PKI](ArcGISRuntime.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Security/CertificateAuthenticationWithPki/readme.md) - Access secured portals using a certificate.

* [ArcGIS token challenge](ArcGISRuntime.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Security/TokenSecuredChallenge/readme.md) - This sample demonstrates how to prompt the user for a username and password to authenticate with ArcGIS Server to access an ArcGIS token-secured service. Accessing secured services requires a login that's been defined on the server.

## Symbology

* [Custom dictionary style](ArcGISRuntime.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Symbology/CustomDictionaryStyle/readme.md) - Use a custom dictionary created from a web style or style file (.stylx) to symbolize features using a variety of attribute values.
* [Feature layer extrusion](ArcGISRuntime.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Symbology/FeatureLayerExtrusion/readme.md) - Extrude features based on their attributes.
* [Render multilayer symbols](ArcGISRuntime.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Symbology/RenderMultilayerSymbols/readme.md) - Show different kinds of multilayer symbols on a map similar to some pre-defined 2D simple symbol styles.
* [Picture marker symbol](ArcGISRuntime.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Symbology/RenderPictureMarkers/readme.md) - Use pictures for markers.
* [Simple marker symbol](ArcGISRuntime.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Symbology/RenderSimpleMarkers/readme.md) - Show a simple marker symbol on a map.
* [Unique value renderer](ArcGISRuntime.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Symbology/RenderUniqueValues/readme.md) - Render features in a layer using a distinct symbol for each unique attribute value.
* [Scene symbols](ArcGISRuntime.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Symbology/SceneSymbols/readme.md) - Show various kinds of 3D symbols in a scene.
* [Simple renderer](ArcGISRuntime.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Symbology/SimpleRenderers/readme.md) - Display common symbols for all graphics in a graphics overlay with a renderer.
* [Read symbols from mobile style](ArcGISRuntime.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Symbology/SymbolsFromMobileStyle/readme.md) - Combine multiple symbols from a mobile style file into a single symbol.
* [Create symbol styles from web styles](ArcGISRuntime.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Symbology/SymbolStylesFromWebStyles/readme.md) - Create symbol styles from a style file hosted on a portal.
