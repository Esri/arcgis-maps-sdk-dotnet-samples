* [ArcGIS token challenge](ArcGISRuntime.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Security/TokenSecuredChallenge/readme.md) - This sample demonstrates how to prompt the user for a username and password to authenticate with ArcGIS Server to access an ArcGIS token-secured service. Accessing secured services requires a login that's been defined on the server.

## Symbology

* [Custom dictionary style](ArcGISRuntime.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Symbology/CustomDictionaryStyle/readme.md) - Use a custom dictionary style (.stylx) to symbolize features using a variety of attribute values.
* [Feature layer extrusion](ArcGISRuntime.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Symbology/FeatureLayerExtrusion/readme.md) - Extrude features based on their attributes.
* [Picture marker symbol](ArcGISRuntime.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Symbology/RenderPictureMarkers/readme.md) - Use pictures for markers.
* [Simple marker symbol](ArcGISRuntime.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Symbology/RenderSimpleMarkers/readme.md) - Show a simple marker symbol on a map.
* [Unique value renderer](ArcGISRuntime.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Symbology/RenderUniqueValues/readme.md) - Render features in a layer using a distinct symbol for each unique attribute value.
* [Scene symbols](ArcGISRuntime.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Symbology/SceneSymbols/readme.md) - Show various kinds of 3D symbols in a scene.
* [Simple renderer](ArcGISRuntime.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Symbology/SimpleRenderers/readme.md) - Display common symbols for all graphics in a graphics overlay with a renderer.
* [Read symbols from mobile style](ArcGISRuntime.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Symbology/SymbolsFromMobileStyle/readme.md) - Combine multiple symbols from a mobile style file into a single symbol.
* [Distance composite scene symbol](ArcGISRuntime.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Symbology/UseDistanceCompositeSym/readme.md) - Change a graphic's symbol based on the camera's proximity to it.

## Utility network

* [Configure subnetwork trace](ArcGISRuntime.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Utility%20network/ConfigureSubnetworkTrace/readme.md) - Get a server-defined trace configuration for a given tier and modify its traversability scope, add new condition barriers and control what is included in the subnetwork trace result.
* [Display utility associations](ArcGISRuntime.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Utility%20network/DisplayUtilityAssociations/readme.md) - Create graphics for utility associations in a utility network.
* [Perform valve isolation trace](ArcGISRuntime.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Utility%20network/PerformValveIsolationTrace/readme.md) - Run a filtered trace to locate operable features that will isolate an area from the flow of network resources.
* [Trace utility network](ArcGISRuntime.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Utility%20network/TraceUtilityNetwork/readme.md) - Discover connected features in a utility network using connected, subnetwork, upstream, and downstream traces.
