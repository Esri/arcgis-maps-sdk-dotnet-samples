* [Render multilayer symbols](ArcGIS.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Symbology/RenderMultilayerSymbols) - Show different kinds of multilayer symbols on a map similar to some pre-defined 2D simple symbol styles.
* [Scene symbols](ArcGIS.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Symbology/SceneSymbols) - Show various kinds of 3D symbols in a scene.
* [Simple marker symbol](ArcGIS.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Symbology/RenderSimpleMarkers) - Show a simple marker symbol on a map.
* [Simple renderer](ArcGIS.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Symbology/SimpleRenderers) - Display common symbols for all graphics in a graphics overlay with a renderer.
* [Unique value renderer](ArcGIS.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/Symbology/RenderUniqueValues) - Render features in a layer using a distinct symbol for each unique attribute value.

## Utility network

* [Configure subnetwork trace](ArcGIS.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/UtilityNetwork/ConfigureSubnetworkTrace) - Get a server-defined trace configuration for a given tier and modify its traversability scope, add new condition barriers and control what is included in the subnetwork trace result.
* [Create load report](ArcGIS.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/UtilityNetwork/CreateLoadReport) - Demonstrates the creation of a simple electric distribution report. It traces downstream from a given point and adds up the count of customers and total load per phase.
* [Display content of utility network container](ArcGIS.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/UtilityNetwork/DisplayUtilityNetworkContainer) - A utility network container allows a dense collection of features to be represented by a single feature, which can be used to reduce map clutter.
* [Display utility associations](ArcGIS.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/UtilityNetwork/DisplayUtilityAssociations) - Create graphics for utility associations in a utility network.
* [Perform valve isolation trace](ArcGIS.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/UtilityNetwork/PerformValveIsolationTrace) - Run a filtered trace to locate operable features that will isolate an area from the flow of network resources.
* [Trace utility network](ArcGIS.WinUI.Viewer/Samples/UtilityNetwork/TraceUtilityNetwork) - Discover connected features in a utility network using connected, subnetwork, upstream, and downstream traces.
