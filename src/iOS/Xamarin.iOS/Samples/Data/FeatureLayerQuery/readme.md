## Use case

Query expressions can be used in ArcGIS to select a subset of features from a feature table. This is most useful in large or complicated data sets. A possible use case might be on a feature table marking the location of street furniture through a city. A user may wish to query by a TYPE column to return "benches". In this sample, we query a U.S. state by STATE_NAME from a feature table containing all U.S. states.

## How to use the sample

Input the name of a U.S. state into the text field. When you tap the button, a query is performed and the matching features are highlighted or an error is returned.

## How it works

1. Create a `ServiceFeatureTable` using the URL of a feature service.
2. Create a `QueryParameters` with a where clause specified using the `WhereClause` property.
3. Perform the query using `QueryFeaturesAsync(query)` on the service feature table.
4. When complete, the query will return a `FeatureQueryResult` which can be iterated over to get the matching features.
