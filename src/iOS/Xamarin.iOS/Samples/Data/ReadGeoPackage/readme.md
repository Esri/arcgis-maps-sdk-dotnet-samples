## Instructions

Select a layer name in the 'Layers Not in the Map' UISegmentedControl to add it to the map. Conversely to remove a layer from the map select a layer name in the 'Layers in the Map' UISegmentedControl. NOTE: The GeoPackage will be downloaded from an ArcGIS Online portal automatically.
