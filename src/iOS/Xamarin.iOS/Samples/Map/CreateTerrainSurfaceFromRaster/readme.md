# Create terrain surface from a local raster

Set the terrain surface with elevation described by a raster file.

## Use case

In a scene view, the terrain surface is what the basemap, operational layers, and graphics are draped onto. For example, when viewing a scene in a mountainous region, applying a terrain surface to the scene will help in recognizing the slopes, valleys, and elevated areas.

## How to use the sample

When loaded, the sample will show a scene with a terrain surface applied. Pan and zoom to explore the scene and observe how the terrain surface allows visualizing elevation differences.

## How it works

1. Create a `Scene` and add it to a `SceneView`.
2. Create a `RasterElevationSource` with a list of raster file paths.
3. Add this source to the scene's base surface: `Scene.BaseSurface.ElevationSources.Add(rasterElevationSource)`.
