# Map reference scale

Set a map's reference scale and control which feature layers should honor that scale.

## Use case

Setting a reference scale on a `Map` fixes the size of symbols and text to the desired height and width at that scale. As you zoom in and out, symbols and text will increase or decrease in size accordingly. When no reference scale is set, symbol and text sizes remain the same size relative to the `MapView`.

Map annotations are typically only relevant at certain scales. For instance, annotations to a map showing a construction site are only relevant at that construction site's scale. So, when the map is zoomed out that information shouldn't scale with the `MapView`, but should instead remain scaled with the `ArcGISMap`. 

## How to use the sample

* Use the 'Set reference scale' button to set the map's reference scale (1:500,000 1:250,000 1:100,000 1:50,000).
* Use the 'Configure layers' button to choose which layers participate in symbol scaling.
* Select the feature layers that should honor the reference scale.

## How it works

1. Get and set the reference scale property on the `Map` object.
1. Get and set the scale symbols property on each individual `FeatureLayer` object.

## Relevant API

* Map
* FeatureLayer

## Additional Information

The map reference scale should normally be set by the map's author and not exposed to the end user like it is in this sample.
