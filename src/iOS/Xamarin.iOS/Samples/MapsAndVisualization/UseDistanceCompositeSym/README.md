### Instructions

1. When the Scene initially loads, you will be looking at a point graphic symbolized with a 3D cone symbol.
2. Zoom slightly closer to the graphic and the symbol will change to a blue 3D cube symbol.
3. Zoom farther from the graphic and the symbol will change back to a 3D cone and then to a simple marker symbol.
