# Find service area (interactive)

Demonstrates how to find services areas around a point using the ServiceAreaTask. A service area shows locations that can be reached from a facility based off a certain impedance [travel time in this case]. Service areas for a two and five minute travel time are used. Barriers can also be added which can effect the service area by not letting traffic through and adding to the time to get to locations.
