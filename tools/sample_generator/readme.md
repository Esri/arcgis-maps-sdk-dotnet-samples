# .NET Sample Generator Script

This script will add all the necessary files for a sample to each platform project in the .NET samples. This will help you avoid a significant amount of copy/paste/renames in Visual Studio.

Basics:

* Run with Python 3
  * On Linux or WSL, use `python3`
  * On Windows, ensure latest Python 3 is installed and added to PATH (its an option in the installer); use `python`
* Usage: `python samplegen.py C:\SamplesDotNET\src -n`
